# CC3k+

This is a production of the game ChamberCrawler3000+ (CC3k+) which is a simplified rogue-like made for CS 247.
Gameplay: Player moves through a dungeon, kills enemies, collects treasure until reaching the end of the dungeon past the 5th floor. To advance through the floors, the player must find a hidden staircase located on each floor. A random enemy on the floor will hold a compass that will reveal the staircase to the next floor. There are potions that randomly spawn on each floor, which may or may not help the player.
